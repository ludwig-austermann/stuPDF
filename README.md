# stuPDF
A simple tool for PDF manipulation

Download python or the exe file if you have not python installed.

The follwing modes are available:
- blanks: automatically adds blank pages to a pdf
- blank: add blank pages to specified pages
- insert: insert a page, similar to blank
- split: split pdf files
- merge: merges pdfs
- rotate: rotates pdf
- cute: experimental, puts two 2 pages onto one (rotated)
- delete: deletes specified pages
- overlay: overlays pages with others
- shuffle: shuffles pdf
- zip: zips several pdfs
- meta: changes metavariables
- info: displays info about pdf

I plan to also add:
- cutebook: similar to cute, but aranges pages such that folded results in a book
